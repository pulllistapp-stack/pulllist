# PullList — Project Status

**Last meaningful update**: 2026-06-15

Authoritative reference for what's been built, what's in progress, what's
planned, and the architectural decisions behind it. Maintained as a flat
markdown so any future session can land on the project and understand the
state in ~10 minutes.

---

## 1. What this is

PullList is a Pokémon TCG **collector platform** (positioning: not a Pokefy
alternative). Free site for catalog/tracker/charts; Pro tier (not yet live)
for restock alerts + power features. Future revenue mix: TCGplayer affiliate
commission + paid subscriptions.

- **Production**: https://pulllist.org
- **Repo**: `pulllistapp-stack/pulllist` (private)
- **Stage**: friends-beta
- **Audience target**: serious Pokémon TCG collectors (1k → 10k → 100k users)

---

## 2. Strategic decisions (locked in via /grill-me)

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Drops main = **store-level restock prediction** | Pokefy doesn't do this — unclaimed niche |
| Q2 | User target = **C: 50-500 paid subscribers** | Realistic indie SaaS scale |
| Q3 | Free/paid cut = **feature cut** (not quantity/time) | Clean, no nickel-and-dime |
| Q4 | Pro pricing = **$5.99/mo or $59/year** | Pokefy is $8 alert-only; we undercut with platform |
| Q5 | Payment infra = **LemonSqueezy** | Merchant of Record handles tax; indie SaaS standard |
| - | Positioning = **PullList = collector platform, NOT Pokefy alternative** | Different category; coexist with Pokefy |
| - | Mobile = **PWA → Google Play $25 → Apple $99/yr** | Phased; $0 to start |
| - | Card scan = **Claude Vision API** | Simple, accurate, ~$0.003/scan |
| - | Capability honest: ~6-12 months sustained to reach Pokefy parity | We have TargetBot anti-bot expertise to draw on |

---

## 3. Built — current state

### 3.1 Foundation
- Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19) frontend → Vercel
- FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + asyncpg backend → Render
- Neon Postgres
- JWT auth (signup / login / me)
- DM Sans + JetBrains Mono fonts
- Light/dark theme via CSS variables (`--bg`, `--text-primary`, etc.) — `next-themes`
- Site-wide footer with mascot, marketplace links, systems-operational pill

### 3.2 Catalog & data
- **12,000+ cards** seeded from pokemontcg.io
- **29 sets** including Mega Evolution era (me2 Phantasmal Flames, me3 Perfect Order, me4 Chaos Rising)
- Card detail page: hero with 3D-tilt + filled-star sparkle hover, price chart, secondary prices, live listings, breadcrumb, neighbors
- Set detail page: hero with logo + completion, sidebar filter (set-scoped rarity options), card grid
- Cards browse with sidebar filter (FilterSidebar): rarity / supertype / energy / subtype / set / artist / HP / price / condition / owned

### 3.3 Pricing pipeline
- **eBay Browse API** (live + daily snapshots)
- **pokemontcg.io daily sync** for TCGplayer + Cardmarket prices
- **Portfolio daily valuation snapshots** (per-user roll-up)
- **3 cron workflows** in GitHub Actions:
  - `daily-ebay-snapshot.yml` (03:00 UTC, 90min timeout)
  - `daily-tcgplayer-sync.yml` (04:00 UTC, 90min timeout)
  - `daily-portfolio-snapshot.yml` (05:00 UTC, 30min timeout)
- **3-layer eBay price sanity filtering** (debugging took 4 rounds):
  - Title noise (PSA grades, sealed product, sleeves, etc.)
  - Min 3 listings before recording (avoid single-outlier medians)
  - Rarity-based absolute floor (SIR ≥ $5, Mega Hyper ≥ $10)
  - TCG-reference-relative band (0.30x to 5.0x of TCGplayer market)
  - Card-number-in-title gate for chase rarities (SIR/IR/Hyper/Rainbow/Mega Hyper)
  - Rarity disambiguator appended to query (SIR / IR / Hyper Rare etc.)

### 3.4 Collection management
- **CollectionItem** model (condition, grade, qty, acquired_at, notes)
- **WishlistItem** model (priority 1-5, max_price_usd, notes)
- **PortfolioSnapshot** model (daily valuation history)
- One-tap "I have this" toggle on every card
- Heart toggle on every card thumbnail for wishlist
- Wishlist target price modal (priority stars + target $ + notes + live "at target" hint)
- Portfolio page: stats grid, asset mix donut, growth chart (SVG area), full vault grouped by set
- Trending page: Top 3 podium (gold/silver/bronze badges), mover rows with sparklines, period+source+direction filters, $1/$5/$10/$50 price floor

### 3.5 Rarity color system
- `lib/rarity.ts` — single source of truth for tier classification
- 13 tiers (common / uncommon / rare / holo / ultra / illustration / sir / mega / hyper / shiny / secret / promo / ace / other)
- Each tier has inactive + active styling
- Used by FilterSidebar chips, CardThumb labels, Trending rows, card detail header, scan results

### 3.6 Mobile / PWA
- `public/manifest.json` + `sw.js` + `PWARegister` client
- Add-to-home-screen on iOS Safari / Android Chrome
- Theme-color metadata for both modes
- Apple touch icon
- **Card scanning** (`/scan` page):
  - Mobile-only camera (`md:hidden`); desktop shows QR code fallback
  - Full-screen camera with Pokémon card aspect ratio targeting overlay
  - Flashlight toggle (when supported — Chrome Android yes, Safari iOS no)
  - Claude Haiku 4.5 vision → JSON identification
  - 3-tier DB fuzzy match (name+number+set → name+number → name only)
  - Top 5 candidates with rarity chip + price + one-tap Add
- **ScanFAB** — floating yellow action button bottom-right, mobile-only, hidden on `/scan`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/cards/*` pages

### 3.7 Homepage & marketing
- Auth-aware HeroCTA (logged-out: signup; logged-in: portfolio + scan)
- Trending strip (top 4 movers from /cards/trending)
- Latest sets section
- Feature pillars (Catalog / Live prices / History)
- Final CTA with mascot sparkles
- Atmospheric glows behind cards

### 3.8 Portfolio sharing (just shipped)
- Non-enumerable share_token URL: `/p/[24-char-base64url]`
- Opt-in public mode (default private)
- Per-section toggles: value / growth / wishlist / all_cards
- Token rotation (invalidates old URL)
- ShareModal on `/portfolio` with copy + rotate
- Public viewer (`/p/[token]`) shows mascot avatar + display name + bio + stats + asset mix + top 20 cards + set completion + optional growth/wishlist/full grid
- "Create your own" CTA at bottom for viral pull
- Open Graph metadata for link previews (image auto-generation = next sprint)

### 3.9 Affiliate / business prep
- TCGplayer affiliate application submitted via impact.com (review 1-2 weeks)
- impact.com site verification meta tag in `<head>`
- "Buy on TCGplayer" buttons throughout card detail (affiliate link slot ready)
- Anthropic API key live (Claude Haiku 4.5 for scanning, ~$5 credit)

### 3.10 Auxiliary projects
- **TargetBot** (separate folder `~/Desktop/TargetBot/`) — Patchright stealth bot for Target.com restock + auto-buy. Validated with real purchases. Domain-knowledge source for anti-bot work in future PullList alert pipeline.

---

## 5. Planned — roadmap

### Sprint 1 (current — partial)
- [x] PWA conversion
- [x] Card scanning V1
- [x] Portfolio sharing V1
- [x] OG image auto-generation (`next/og`) for share link previews —
      `/p/[token]/opengraph-image.tsx`, renders display name, value,
      stats, with brand stripe; Twitter summary_large_image wired
- [x] CSV export endpoint + button (Portfolio page → "Export CSV")
- [ ] Best Buy in-store predictive monitor V1 (single retailer, US only)
- [ ] Discord webhook + Email alert delivery
- [ ] Wishlist target-price alert dispatch (uses existing target field)
- [ ] Daily portfolio digest email

### Sprint 2
- [ ] LemonSqueezy integration (Subscription model + webhooks)
- [ ] Pro tier gating middleware
- [ ] `/pricing` marketing page
- [ ] Scan daily rate-limit enforcement (5/day free, unlimited Pro)
- [ ] User Settings page (notification prefs, ZIP, alert channels)

### Sprint 3+
- [ ] Costco / Microcenter / GameStop monitors (one per ~month)
- [ ] Walmart "Potential droplet" early-info detection (catalog entry monitoring)
- [ ] Expo (React Native) build for Google Play Store ($25 one-time)
- [ ] Trade calculator
- [ ] Wishlist sharing (separate token, different from portfolio token)
- [ ] Friend connections / collection comparison
- [ ] **Multi-language Pokémon coverage (JP / KR)** — gated on EN catalog being
      considered "done". The competitive moat: Pokefy is English-first, and
      PriceCharting has multi-language but a clunky UX. Phased plan:
  1. Add `Card.language` field (en/ja/ko) + migration
  2. JP catalog ingest — pokemontcg.io for 2023+ sets, then Pokellector
     scrape to backfill vintage. Catalog only, no JP pricing yet.
  3. Frontend language tabs (EN / JP / KR) on Sets and Cards browse
  4. KR catalog = JP-derive (same physical card, KR text overlay). Add
     `Card.kr_name`, `Card.kr_set_name` via pokemonkorea.co.kr scrape.
  5. KREAM pricing integration for KR cards — internal API scrape with
      retries/alerts on shape change. KR-only secondary chart tab.
  6. User-submitted KR name corrections (small community wiki layer to
     fill anything KREAM/pokemonkorea miss).
  Expected lift: ~1.5–2 weeks for steps 1–4 (catalog), KREAM pricing is
  ongoing-maintenance work.

### Future / not committed
- [ ] Apple App Store ($99/yr) — gate behind ~$500/mo MRR
- [ ] Auto-buy integration with linked retailer accounts (legally gray)
- [ ] Other TCGs — Magic (Scryfall API), One Piece, Lorcana, Yu-Gi-Oh
- [ ] PSA / BGS graded-slab specific tracking
- [ ] eBay sold-listings (Finding API) — PriceCharting-style accuracy upgrade
- [ ] User-submitted price corrections (crowdsourcing, beyond names)
- [ ] Tournament event tracking / deck builder integration

## 6. Known quirks / non-bugs

| Issue | Why it's not a bug | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| New Mega Evolution sets show no TCGplayer prices | pokemontcg.io has 1-2 week lag for new sets; everybody else (including Pokefy) faces the same upstream constraint | eBay fills the gap; we have rarity-floor sanity guards |
| Trending page shows nothing for ~24h after deploy | Need 2+ snapshots of same (card, source, variant) for delta calculation | Wait one day after cron starts |
| Render free-tier cold start can take 30-50s | Backend free tier behavior; first request after idle is slow | Workflow timeouts set to 90min; user-facing pages tolerate via SSR |
| GitHub Actions scheduled crons sometimes need manual first-trigger | GitHub Actions can lag on new workflow schedule recognition | One manual `Run workflow` click confirms they're alive |
| Safari iOS doesn't expose camera torch | Browser-level limitation; not our code | Torch toggle silently hidden when unsupported |
| TCGplayer direct API is closed to new applicants | Post-eBay acquisition policy | We use pokemontcg.io (their official partner) for legal price data |
| eBay daily quota (5,000/day on free tier) | API limit | snapshot script uses `--max-calls 4500` with throttle; if hit, snapshot continues next day |

## 11. The grill-me decisions in one paragraph

We are **NOT trying to be Pokefy**. Pokefy is a $8/mo Discord-based alert
service with multi-region multi-retailer coverage built up over years.
PullList is a **collector platform** — alerts are one feature among many,
not the product. We compete in a different category: collection tracking +
portfolio + wishlist + price history + scanning + sharing, with restock
alerts as a Pro-tier hook for the small subset of users who care most about
day-one buying. This means we can launch with one retailer (Best Buy) and
"good enough" alert quality — because the platform value carries the
subscription. Payment via LemonSqueezy at $5.99/mo. Free forever for the
platform; Pro for power users. Long-term revenue mix: affiliate (TCGplayer
3.5% on referred sales) + Pro subscriptions.
